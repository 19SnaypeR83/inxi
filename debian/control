Description: System info script for irc
 Inxi is a system information script for IRC (Internet Relay Chat) clients.
 A system information script can display all kinds of things about your 
 hardware and software to users in a chatroom,  so they can help you diagnose 
 problems, ... or just marvel at your system specs and kernel version ;)
 It was created to serve the need for a infoscript that isn't dependent on a 
 particular irc client. Because most irc clients support the /exec command, a 
 script that runs with /exec would be most portable.
 .
 inxi is a fork of infobash 3.02, the original bash sys info script by locsmif
 As time permits functionality improvements and recoding will occur.
 .
 inxi is tested with Irssi, Xchat, Konversation, BitchX, KSirc, ircII,
 Gaim/Pidgin, Weechat, KVIrc and Kopete.
